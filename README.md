# MusicSheetDsl
Domain-specific language Sheet Music modeling. The language allows the user to easily print the note system (with all its elements) of the desired composition, to convert it to the desired key (bass or violin), to generate musical chords, to print the text of the composition or the name of each specific note.
After this, the user would get a .musicxml file that can run in most music editors and music compositing tools and get a graphical and audio representation of their music system.
