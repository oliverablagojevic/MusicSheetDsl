# MusicSheetDsl
Domain-specific language for sheet music modeling. [Project for subject called Domain Specific Modeling and Languages.]
The language allows the user to easily print the note system (with all its elements) of the desired composition, to generate musical chords, to print the text of the composition or the name of each specific note.
After this, the user would get a .musicxml file that can run in most music editors and music compositing tools and get a graphical and audio representation of their music system.
